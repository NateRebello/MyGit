# MyGit

Welcome to **MyGit**, a meticulously crafted Python-based version control system designed to streamline your development process with elegance and efficiency! This project brings to life a suite of powerful commands—initiate repositories with `mygit-init`, track changes with `mygit-add` and `mygit-commit`, review history with `mygit-log`, manage files with `mygit-rm` and `mygit-status`, and handle branches with `mygit-branch`, `mygit-checkout`, and `mygit-merge`. Built to mirror the robustness of Git, MyGit offers a lightweight yet functional alternative, showcasing advanced Python scripting skills and a deep understanding of version control semantics.

Housed within the `.mygit` directory, this tool stores your project history securely, supporting sequential commit numbering and conflict-free branching. Whether you’re switching branches or merging changes, MyGit provides a reliable foundation for managing your codebase!
